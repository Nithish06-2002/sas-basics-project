# SAS Basics Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate basic SAS programming skills required for entry-level Clinical SAS and Clinical Data roles. This project focuses on creating a sample dataset and performing simple data analysis using common SAS procedures.

## Tools Used
- SAS Studio (OnDemand for Academics) – for executing SAS programs
- VS Code – for writing and organizing SAS code
- GitHub – for version control and project presentation

## SAS Concepts Used
- DATA step – to create a sample dataset using datalines
- PROC PRINT – to display the dataset
- PROC SORT – to sort data by age
- PROC MEANS – to calculate summary statistics
- PROC FREQ – to generate frequency tables
